## Introduction
Coreshield is an on-chain insurance platform with a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) where anyone can insure anything from their properties to their life and have their insurance certificate on-chain. The goal is to decentralize insurance using DAO voting for each proposal raised and to ensure payments are made instantly.
